    <a href="./post/hyper-dynamic.html"> Static types vs contracts </a>
    </br></br>
    Everyone these days seems to be excited about static type systems.
    Well, I don't like that. Why did we suddenly forgot about the undeniable advantage of dynamic types - the mighty expressiveness that comes from the knowledge of runtime itself!
    Let me demonstrate.
    <pre><code>  x: random.choice([<keyword>String</keyword>, <keyword>Int</keyword>]) = read(<quote>"2"</quote>)</code></pre>
    See? Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

    <a href="./post/incognito.html"> Why I use incognito </a>
    </br></br>
    Logging on requirement is usually an abuse. Most services don't need it, yet they will require me to register. Incognito mode changed my perception of such services. It is similar to how disabling javascript by default works - just like I got more likely to leave a website that required javascript for no apparent reason, it also became harder to tolerate websites that require me to authenticate for no reason.

    </br>
    </br>
    Kernel is an interesting lisp, with its every construct being first-class. That, combined with all of the nice features of other lisps, like macros and continuations, makes it really powerful. But Kernel is not a hype lang. There are several compilers, yet most of them don't implement the language fully, and many of them don't handle even basic examples. One interesting thing about compiling Kernel is that you don't have to worry about optimizations - it has been proven that the high expressiveness of Kernel makes its code practically non-optimizable.
