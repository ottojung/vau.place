    <a href="./post/javascript-falsy.html"> The incredible complexity of Javascript's <span class="keyword">if</span> </a>
    <br><br>
    Conditional branching... The most fundamental construct in all of programming, the simplest of control flows, the most common of language constructs, the first one to learn, and the basis of all machine learning.
    Its importance is hard to overestimate.
    But have you ever thought what <i>really</i> happens when a language interpreter encounters an <span class="keyword">if</span> statement?

    <a href="./post/hyper-dynamic.html"> Static types vs contracts </a>
    <br><br>
    Everyone these days seems to be excited about static type systems.
    Well, I don't like that. Why did we suddenly forgot about the undeniable advantage of dynamic types - the mighty expressiveness that comes from the knowledge of runtime itself!
    Let me demonstrate.
    <pre><code>  x: random.choice([<span class="keyword">String</span>, <span class="keyword">Int</span>]) = read(<span class="quote">"2"</span>)</code></pre>
    See? Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

    <a href="./post/kernel.html"> Have you seen Kernel? </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    I like Kernel. It is such a simple language, yet so beautifully powerful.
    It is a lisp, you know, but more in the schemey-way.
    So there is homoiconicity and hygienic macros and continuations.
    All baked into the language.
    But unlike other lisps, Kernel has it all <i>first-class</i>!
