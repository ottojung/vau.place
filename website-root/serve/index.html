    Logging on requirement is usually an abuse. Most services don't need it, yet they will require you to register. Incognito mode changes the way you look at these abusive websites. It is similar to how disabling javascript by default works - just like you are more likely to leave a website that requires javascript for no apparent reason, it will also be an annoyance to enter credentials every time you want to view something.

    Kernel is an interesting lisp, with its every construct being first-class. That, combined with all of the nice features of other lisps, like macros and continuations, makes it really powerful. But Kernel is not a hype lang. There are several compilers, yet most of them don't implement the language fully, and many of them don't handle even basic examples. One interesting thing about compiling Kernel is that you don't have to worry about optimizations - it has been proven that the high expressiveness of Kernel makes its code practically non-optimizable.
