    <a href="./post/hyper-dynamic.html"> Static types vs contracts </a>
    </br></br>
    Everybody these days seems to like static type systems.
    But there is an obvious advantage of dynamic languages - you can express more at runtime.
    Contracts check types at runtime and thus allow us to do stuff like:
    <pre><code>(<keyword>define/contract</keyword> bitcoin-price
  (<keyword>if</keyword> (system <quote>"ping -c 1 rate.sx"</quote>) number? false?) <comment>; check if there is a connection</comment>
  (string->number (shell <quote>"curl rate.sx/10BTC"</quote>)))   <comment>; convert to number right away</comment> </code></pre>
    Now do that with your dependent types 😊

    <a href="./post/incognito.html"> Why I use incognito </a>
    </br></br>
    Logging on requirement is usually an abuse. Most services don't need it, yet they will require me to register. Incognito mode changed the way I look at such services. It is similar to how disabling javascript by default works - just like I got more likely to leave a website that required javascript for no apparent reason, it also became harder to tolerate websites that required me to authenticate for no reason.

    </br>
    </br>
    Kernel is an interesting lisp, with its every construct being first-class. That, combined with all of the nice features of other lisps, like macros and continuations, makes it really powerful. But Kernel is not a hype lang. There are several compilers, yet most of them don't implement the language fully, and many of them don't handle even basic examples. One interesting thing about compiling Kernel is that you don't have to worry about optimizations - it has been proven that the high expressiveness of Kernel makes its code practically non-optimizable.
