    <br><br>
    Everyone these days seems to be excited about static type systems.
    Well, I don't like that. Why did we suddenly forgot about the undeniable advantage of dynamic types - the mighty expressiveness that comes from the knowledge of runtime itself!
    Let me demonstrate.
    <pre><code>  x: random.choice([<span class="keyword">String</span>, <span class="keyword">Int</span>]) = read(<span class="quote">"2"</span>)</code></pre>
    See? Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

    <a href="./post/kernel.html"> Have you seen Kernel? </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    I like Kernel. It is such a simple language, yet so beautifully powerful.
    It is a lisp, you know, but more in the schemey-way. So there is homoiconicity and macros and continuations, all backed into the language.
    But, unlike other lisps, Kernel has it all <i>first-class</i>!
