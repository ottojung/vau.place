Programming languages:

    Kernel is an interesting lisp language with every construct being first-class.
    </br>
    This, combined with all of the nice features of other lisps, like macros and continuations, make it a trully powerful tool.

    Despite this, Kernel is not a hype lang. Sure, there are several compilers, but most of them don't implement the language fully, and many of them simply don't work. One interesting thing about compiling Kernel is that you don't have to worry about optimizations - it has been proven that the high expressiveness of Kernel makes its code practically non-optimizable.
