  <h3> I made a programming language </h3>

  For my graduation thesis, I decided to to make a programming language, and it was a lot of fun.
  The language is academic, but it is pacman-complete -- I use it myself every day as a calculator replacement.
  Please, take a look and send comments!

  Without further ado, here is the thesis paper that defines the language: <a href="./rose-lang-thesis.pdf">rose-lang-thesis.pdf</a> (<a href="./rose-lang-thesis.pdf.gpg">signature</a>).
  There is a reference interpreter too: <a href="//git.vau.place/schrec.git">git.vau.place/schrec.git</a>.
