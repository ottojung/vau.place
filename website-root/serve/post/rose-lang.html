  <h3> I made a programming language </h3>

  For my graduation thesis, I decided to make a programming language, and it was a lot of fun.
  The language is academic, but it is pacman-complete -- I use it myself every day as a calculator replacement.
  Please, take a look and send comments!
  <br><br>

  Without further ado, here is the thesis paper that defines the language: <a href="./rose-lang-thesis.pdf">rose-lang-thesis.pdf</a>.
  There is a reference interpreter too: <a href="//git.vau.place/schrec.git">git.vau.place/schrec.git</a>.

  <br><br>

  The paper says everything one might want to know about the language, and a lot more...
  The language is simple, really, and it's absolutely not necessary to understand its formal semantics to understand it.
  So, a hint for those who don't want to read 60 pages of dense symbology --
  go to the implementation repository and look at examples/ I have there.
  If you know rewriting, those examples should be enough to really get the language.
  For those that don't, I still suggest to skip towards examples in the paper --
  there are many of them and they are somewhat explained.

  <br><br>

  If you have comments or questions, write them to my email (found in the paper or <a href="/other.html">here</a>),
  I would love to hear them.
