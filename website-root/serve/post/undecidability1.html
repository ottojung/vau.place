  <h3> Based undecidability proof </h3>

  <!-- Based of what? Based on facts and logic, that's what! -->
  Today we are going to take a century old fact from computability theory, and explain it in a way that even zoomers, and only zoomers, will understand.
  For that, we will develop a <i>based proof</i>, i.e. a proof that is based on <b>facts</b> and <b>logic</b>, instead of relying on hand waving.

  <br><br>

  Ok, but why?
  <!-- TODO: ramble against halting problem proofs -->

  <br><br>

  So what are we working with?

  ...

  Don't worry about the implementation, we are doing <i>language design</i> here.
