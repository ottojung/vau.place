  <h3> Why I use incognito </h3>
  Logging on requirement is usually an abuse. Most services don't need it, yet they will require me to register. Incognito mode changed the way I look at such services. It is similar to how disabling javascript by default works - just like I got more likely to leave a website that required javascript for no apparent reason, it also became harder to tolerate websites that required me to authenticate for no reason.
