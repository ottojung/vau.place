  <h3> Haskell history (paper review from a lisper) </h3>

  And to maybe debunk some of the misconceptions about Haskell the language.

  > 3.5 Haskell is a committee language
  Haskell is a language designed by committee, and conventional
  wisdom would say that a committee language will be full of
  warts and awkward compromises.

  <pre><code>
  > 2.6 Was Haskell a joke?
  The first edition of the Haskell Report was published on April 1,
  1990. It was mostly an accident that it appeared on April Fool’s
  Day—a date had to be chosen, and the release was close enough to
  April 1 to justify using that date.
