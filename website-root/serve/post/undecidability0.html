  <h3> Simple undecidable problem </h3>

  When explaining undecidability, halting problem is usually used as an example.
  But some people, including youger me, have doubts when presented with its proof.
  And rightfully so, since the proof involves Cantor's diagonal argument.
  Thus, here I want to give a proof of a slightly different problem which may be easier to understand.

  <br><br>

  To support my point on why one should be forgiven for not trusting the halting problem proofs, here is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05340">a paper</a> that critisizes the problem itself.

  <br><br>

  The the problem I chose is not related to halting, but it does require some background.
  Let me start with recursion normal form theorem.
  Intuitively, it says that every program can be rewritten in such a way that unrestricted loop is only used once.
  Formally, this means that every recursive function <span id="high">f</span> can be constructed in the following way:

  <pre><code>  f(x) = <span id="keyword">S</span>(<span id="keyword">μ</span><sub>y</sub> <span id="keyword">T</span>(ϕ<sub>f</sub>, x, y))</code></pre>

  Where <span id="high">ϕ<sub>f</sub></span> is the code of the original function <span id="high">f</span>, <span id="high">T</span> is a primitive predicate that associates the application of <span id="high">f(x)</span> with its <i>history of evaluation</i> <span id="high">y</span>, <span id="high">μ</span> is a minimization operator that searches for a minimal such <span id="high">y</span> that satisfies <span id="high">T</span>, and <span id="high">S</span> is another primitive function that returns just the result from the entire history <span id="high">y</span>.

  <br><br>

  The proof of this theorem is not hard, but is too large to fit in the margins of this webpage.
