  <h3> Have you seen Kernel? </h3>
  I like Kernel. It is such a simple language, yet so beautifully powerful.
  It is a lisp, you know, but more in the schemey-way. So there is homoiconicity and macros and continuations, all baked into the language.
  But, unlike other lisps, Kernel has it all <i>first-class</i>!

  <br><br>

  The main secret ingredient of Kernel is in its minimal core based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexpr"><span class="high">fexpr</span></a>s -
  a concept so powerful that all other lisps resigned from it in fear!

  The problem is, fexpred-code cannot be optimized A BIT. Not that it is optimal by construction, just that the compiler cannot MAKE IT more optimal.
  But Kernel is a wonderful language to write compiler for, and there are plenty of them in the wild. Probably more that there are users of Kernel.
  I guess that makes Kernel an academia-language.
  That, and the fact that it is completely and formally specified in the <a href="https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-090110-124904/unrestricted/jshutt.pdf">autor's PhD dissertation</a>.
  It is quite an interesting read by the way, but for starters,
  I would rather recommend <a href="https://axisofeval.blogspot.com/2011/09/kernel-underground.html"> The Kernel Underground</a>.
  So if you are open to new, wierd, lispy concepts, then take a look and happy hacking!
