  <h3> Information theory speedrun </h3>

  Ah, information theory.
  The name itself makes one consider computer science carier.
  But then, there is only so much time left for us on this planet,
  and so many other things to see and do.
  So this post will try to get you into the subject in the shortest time possible,
  and as a side-effect, set the world record in speedruning a standard information theory course.
