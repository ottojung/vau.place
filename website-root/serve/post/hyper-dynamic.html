  <h3> Static types vs contracts </h3>
  Everyone these days seems to be excited about static type systems.
  Well, I don't like that. Why did we suddenly forgot about the undeniable advantage of dynamic types - the mighty expressiveness that comes from the knowledge of runtime itself!
  Let me demonstrate.
  <pre><code>  x: random.choice([<keyword>String</keyword>, <keyword>Int</keyword>]) = read(<quote>"2"</quote>)</code></pre>
  See? Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

  <br><br>

  It is almost a meme at this point how dynamic types are being justified,
  yet no good real world example to be seen.
  Ironically as well, I did not prepare one myself, you cought me off guard.
  Or did you? See, typing is not like most of those things...
  You grow up as a programmer, using type discipline.
  You develop habits and skills, you adopt.
  Maybe you even become an expert, you tame those types, make them dance for you, coworkers are jelous.
  And at that point, the only thing I can say, is you just got to feel it, man.
  You either get it or don't, no examples necessary.
  The only thing I hope for is that you did not grow up on Haskell, cuz that stuff just makes people different.
  "I thought we were friends, but now you don't talk to lispers".

  <!-- This post is not a meme however. In this post we figure stuff out. 
       So, in case you didn't know contracts, let me introduce.
       Racket implements contracts out of the box. They are great and state of the art (it's an old art, okay?).  -->

    <!-- Dynamically typed languages started to adopt some forms of gradual typing. -->
