  <h3> Static types vs contracts </h3>
    Everyone these days seems to be excited about static type systems.
    Well, I don't like that. Why did we suddenly forgot about the undeniable advantage of dynamic types - the mighty expressiveness that comes from the knowledge of runtime itself!
    Let me demonstrate.
    <pre><code>  x: random.choice([<keyword>String</keyword>, <keyword>Int</keyword>]) = read(<quote>"2"</quote>)</code></pre>
    See? Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

    <!-- Dynamically typed languages started to adopt some forms of gradual typing. -->

    <!-- TODO: finish -->
