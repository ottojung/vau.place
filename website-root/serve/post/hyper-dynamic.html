  <h3> Static types vs contracts </h3>
    Everybody these days seems to like static type systems.
    But there is an obvious advantage to dynamic types - they are more expressive because they work at runtime.
    Contracts check types at runtime and thus allow for stuff like:
    <pre><code>  x: random.choice([<keyword>String</keyword>, <keyword>Int</keyword>]) = read(<quote>"2"</quote>)</code></pre>
    Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

    <!-- Dynamically typed languages started to adopt some forms of gradual typing. -->

    <!-- TODO: finish -->
