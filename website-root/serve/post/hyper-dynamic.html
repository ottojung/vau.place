  <h3> Static types vs contracts </h3>
    Everybody these days seems to like static type systems.
    But there is an obvious advantage of dynamic languages - you can express more at runtime.
    Contracts check types at runtime and thus allow for stuff like:
    <pre><code>(<keyword>define/contract</keyword> bitcoin-price
  (<keyword>if</keyword> (system <quote>"ping -c 1 rate.sx"</quote>) number? false?) <comment>; `bitcoin-price` is a number iff we can query rate.sx</comment>
  (string->number (shell <quote>"curl rate.sx/10BTC"</quote>)))   <comment>; `string->number` returns false on error</comment> </code></pre>
    Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

    <!-- Dynamically typed languages started to adopt some forms of gradual typing. -->

    <!-- TODO: finish -->
