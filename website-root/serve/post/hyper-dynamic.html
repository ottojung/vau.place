  <h3> Static types vs contracts </h3>
    Everybody these days seems to like static type systems.
    But there is an obvious advantage of dynamic languages - you can express more at runtime.
    Contracts check types at runtime and thus allow for stuff like:
    <pre><code> x: random.choice([<keyword>String</keyword>, <keyword>Int</keyword>]) = read <quote>"2"</quote> </code></pre>
    Now do that with your dependent types ðŸ˜Š

    <!-- Dynamically typed languages started to adopt some forms of gradual typing. -->

    <!-- TODO: finish -->
