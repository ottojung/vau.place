# Hello

This is the code for the main website.

This repo has some other files as well, but it missess a lot of server configuration files.
If you want those, visit [LandChad.net](https://landchad.net).

The website is written by hand instead of being generated because I like this site to not be generic.

I sometimes validate pages [here](https://validator.w3.org/nu) and [here](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator).
